## üîç Results and Achievements

As a result of this thesis work, an innovative system for counting and analyzing chip production has been successfully developed, focusing on improving the efficiency and accuracy of the production process. By implementing automated chip counting procedures, the system aims to reduce the time operators spend on data entry and the most critical factor in any production ‚Äì minimizing human error.

- The system allows for the collection of production data, including the number of chips produced at the end of each shift, which are automatically updated on the server. This data is crucial for analyzing the production process and making decisions to improve efficiency and quality.

- The system is based on the use of various devices, including Raspberry Pi Model 4 B, E3NX-CA41 amplifier, FTP server, and optical sensor E32-CC200. These components work together to provide automated chip counting and reliable data collection for the production process.

- Achieving the goal of implementing automated procedures for counting the throughput of the "X" processing machine represents a key challenge in the modern industrial environment. This is particularly important for maintaining the competitiveness and efficiency of production processes in an era where speed and accuracy are essential for business success.

- By utilizing an additional monitoring module and system integration, the project's aim is to achieve automated reporting of the throughput and availability of the "X" machine. This will lead to significant improvements in operational efficiency and provide up-to-date and reliable information for strategic and operational decision-making.

- Implementing this innovative system for counting and analyzing chip production represents an intelligent approach to managing production processes. This will not only facilitate operators in their tasks of monitoring and managing processing devices but also increase the transparency and reliability of the data, which is crucial for the quality and safety of the production process.

- In the future, the machine will be developed to handle a wider range of chips, with specific requirements including the installation of a monitoring module and software updates for automated counting of the produced chips. This approach is essential for industrial enterprises aiming to optimize their production processes and remain competitive in the market.

- A profitable forecast indicates that it is more appropriate to optimize a specific machine rather than investing millions in brand new machines, which would take longer to integrate into the busy workflow.
